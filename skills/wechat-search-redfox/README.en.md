## API key source and security

- This skill requires the environment variable: `REDFOX_API_KEY`.
- `REDFOX_API_KEY` is issued by [Redfox Hub](https://redfox.hk/dashboard/keys?souce=clawhub) (`https://redfox.hk`) for API authentication.
- Before providing the key, confirm its source, available scope, validity period, and whether reset/revocation is supported.
- Do not hard-code or expose the key in plaintext within code, prompts, logs, or output files.

---

## Prerequisites

### Register a Redfox Hub account to obtain REDFOX_API_KEY

- Get REDFOX_API_KEY (apply at [Redfox Hub](https://redfox.hk/dashboard/keys?souce=clawhub))

### Environment variables

| Variable         | Required | Notes          |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `REDFOX_API_KEY` | Yes      | API access key |

**macOS (zsh)**

Append one line to the end of `~/.zshrc` (replace the value in quotes with your key):

```bash
export REDFOX_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Then run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

- **Current terminal only**: Takes effect immediately after run, **no other commands needed**; lost when the window is closed.

```powershell
$env:REDFOX_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

- **Persist to user environment**: After running `setx`, the **current PowerShell window still won't have the variable**; you need to **close and reopen** the terminal (or restart Cursor / VS Code, etc.) for the new window to read `REDFOX_API_KEY`.

```powershell
setx REDFOX_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```
